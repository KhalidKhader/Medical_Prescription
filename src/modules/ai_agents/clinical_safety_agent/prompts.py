MEDICATION SAFETY ASSESSMENT

Medication Details:
- Drug Name: {drug_name}
- Strength: {strength}
- Raw Prescription: {instructions}
- Patient Instructions: {sig_english}

{rxnorm_info}

CLINICAL SAFETY EVALUATION FRAMEWORK:

1. DOSAGE SAFETY ANALYSIS
   - Verify appropriate dosing range for medication
   - Check for potential overdose or underdose risks
   - Assess frequency appropriateness

2. ADMINISTRATION ROUTE VALIDATION
   - Confirm route matches drug formulation
   - Verify route is clinically appropriate
   - Check for route-specific safety concerns

3. DRUG-SPECIFIC SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
   - Identify medication-specific warnings
   - Assess contraindications and precautions
   - Consider age-related dosing adjustments

4. INSTRUCTION CLARITY & SAFETY
   - Evaluate potential for patient confusion
   - Assess medication error risk factors
   - Check for missing critical information

5. CLINICAL APPROPRIATENESS
   - Verify instructions align with standard practice
   - Check for unusual or concerning patterns
   - Assess overall therapeutic reasonableness

SAFETY SCORING CRITERIA:
- 90-100: Excellent safety profile, minimal concerns
- 80-89: Good safety, minor considerations noted  
- 70-79: Acceptable with cautions, monitoring recommended
- 60-69: Safety concerns present, review required
- Below 60: Significant safety issues, intervention needed

Return ONLY a JSON object with this exact structure:
{{
    "safety_score": 0-100,
    "safety_flags": ["specific safety concerns if any"],
    "recommendations": ["specific safety recommendations"],
    "risk_level": "LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH",

    "monitoring_requirements": ["specific monitoring needs if any"]

DRUG INTERACTION ANALYSIS

Medications to Evaluate:
{chr(10).join([f"- {med}" for med in medications])}

INTERACTION ASSESSMENT CRITERIA:

1. MAJOR INTERACTIONS (Contraindicated)
   - Life-threatening or serious adverse outcomes
   - Requires immediate intervention

2. MODERATE INTERACTIONS (Monitor Closely)  
   - Clinically significant effects possible
   - May require dosage adjustments or monitoring

3. MINOR INTERACTIONS (Be Aware)
   - Limited clinical significance
   - Generally manageable with awareness

CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Pharmacokinetic interactions (absorption, metabolism, excretion)
- Pharmacodynamic interactions (additive, synergistic, antagonistic effects)
- Timing-dependent interactions
- Patient-specific risk factors

Return ONLY a JSON object:

Overall Safety Score: {overall_score:.1f}/100

SUMMARY REQUIREMENTS:

1. OVERALL SAFETY STATUS
   - Safe (â‰¥90): Prescription meets high safety standards
   - Caution (70-89): Acceptable with noted precautions  
   - Unsafe (<70): Significant safety concerns require intervention

2. KEY SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
   - Highlight most important safety points
   - Identify any critical interventions needed
   - Note monitoring requirements

3. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS
   - Specific actions for prescriber/pharmacist
   - Patient counseling points
   - Follow-up requirements
